### Claire Paper Prototypes
My first paper prototype is when someone has already selected on the "Exploring Northern California" blog post. It shows the length of the route and then blog posts, instagram feeds, etc.

This is anotheri teration of the first prototype, with a different aesthetic.

This one focuses on the app index page, where we focus more so on how to view different diaries in one place. This is an overview page.

### April Paper Prototypes
My paper prototype displays interactions from a user who wants to see past trips and edit them as well a user who wants to create new trips. To create a new trip, a user must first enter locations they have traveled to. Our app will then generate pins and a show a route. To edit an already created trip, users can click on the trip and then the edit button. From there, they will be able to move around the pins on the map and edit their diary entry.
