Project Proposal: Travel Diaries

Project Summary:
Record your adventures and share it with friends as an interactive travel diary. Organize your travel experiences so you can look back and remember the amazing trips youâ€™ve had.

Storyboard:


Feedback:
Our classmates liked our ideas related to travel itineraries and mapping flights. Our TA, Kandarp mentioned that the app should have multiple functionalities, as the class is programming heavy. Taking these comments into consideration, we decided to create a travel diary app.

Project Features:
With our app, users will be able to log their travels with an interactive map. At each destination of a trip, users may upload pictures, write text entries, and enter the dates they stayed at that destination.  Users will be able to visualize the routes of their location and stops along their journey.  Users will also be able to share their travel diary with friends. Entries within the diary will have different visibility settings, including only user (personal), shared with (friends), and public.  The app will be dynamic, but it will aid in sharing an image of your overall journey for sharing. 

Programming work:  
Claire: I can work on the functionality needed in order to log their journal entries and photos with friends for interactivity. I will also work on the user interface and the iterations for the front end design associated with these functionalities.
Devon:  Will work on social functionality, to share trip and share visuals of route.  Will help with map integration and general UI.  Will do repeated user tests and use results to revise app accordingly. 
Max: Can work on programming for front and back end.
April: I can work on integrating a map API and general UI elements as well as front end design iterations. I can also help with backend maintenance.
