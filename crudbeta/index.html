<p> Framework for whatever you want to do can go here for the application. </p>
<p> This is a basic form that allows you to submit input values and handle reading them, I just made an arbitrary form and name but we can change this to literally anything you want it to do. </p>

	  <form action="/trips" method="POST"> 
	  <input type="text" placeholder="Name of Trip" name="trip">
	  <input type="text" placeholder="Location" name="location">	  	
	  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
