--> What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.

The app, Travel Diaries, allows users to publish diary entries based on their travel experiences. 
Social media such as Facebook and Instagram can be integrated into the entry, along with an interactive map. 
Users may also search othersâ€™ entries in order to find travel inspiration, local gems, and more.

--> How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?

Current blogs only have a write and edit feature, but images are not integrated and there is no map functionality. 

--> What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?

Our approach integrates the places you've been to in an interactive, visual manner. You can actually see all of the destinations
that you've been to, instead of just seeing it in text form. 

--> Who cares? If you're successful, what difference will it make? 

People who travel and would like an easy way to organize and view the places they've been would enjoy our app. People looking to travel 
would also be able to use our app to help plan their trips in a more efficient manner.
