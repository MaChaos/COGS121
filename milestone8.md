*April - Search results and filters, Users may search by city and filter their searches by tags after they have searched. Search results come up with a map of the city's regions and a list of trips that have gone to the searched city. Users may search again by typing in the search bar under the map.*

*I made a paper prototype of the side bar filtering functionality. I want for there to be a way to search what type of category you are interested in searching and/or the city that you are coming from. You can select both category (ex: foodie) and / or select location (ex: San Diego). if you would like to see all entries of "must eat entries for foodies", then you can also just only search for one entry.*
